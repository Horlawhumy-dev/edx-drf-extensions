"""
Public Python API for REST documentation.

The functions are split into separate files for code organization,
but they are imported into here so they can be imported
directly from `edx_api_doc_tools`.

When adding new functions to this API,
add them to the appropriate sub-module,
and then "expose" them here by importing them.

Use explicit imports (as opposed to * imports)
so that we hide internal names and keep this module
a nice catalog of functions.
